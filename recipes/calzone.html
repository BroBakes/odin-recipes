          <h1>CALZONE</h1>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A preparation of bread dough folded into a filled pizza, the calzone is characteristic of various southern Italian cuisines. The dough is folded into a half circle or tube, either baked or fried. The most famous are the “Neapolitan” calzones, filled with ricotta cheese, provolone cheese, crumbled salami and pecorino cheese. But there are various versions that may contain tomato, mozzarella and ham, or vegetables and mozzarella.</p>
         <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 lb pizza dough</li>
            <li>1 cup pizza sauce</li>
            <li>1 cup pepperoni</li>
            <li>1/2 cup salami</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella</li>
            <li>1 cup ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>2 tbsp oil</li>
            <li>1/2 cup parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Preheat the oven to 475 °F. Line the baking sheet with parchment paper or spray it with oil.</li> 
          <li>Divide the dough into 8 equally sized pieces. Roll each piece into a 1/4" thick circle.</li>
          <li>Place the filling on half of each circle (pizza sauce, ricotta, pepperoni, salami and shredded mozzarella). Make sure to leave the edges clean to allow for sealing the calzone. Fold the side over the filling and crimp the edges.</li>
          <li>Place calzones on a baking sheet, leaving space apart. Cut a small vent on the top of each calzone. Brush the tops with oil and sprinkle with parmesan cheese. Bake for 15 minutes or until golden brown.</li>
        </ol>
